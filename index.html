            <h2>About Naruto</h2>
            <p>Naruto Uzumaki is a fictional character in the manga and anime franchise of the same name, created by Masashi Kishimoto. Serving as the eponymous protagonist of the series, he is a young ninja from the fictional village of Konohagakure (Hidden Leaf Village). The villagers ridicule and ostracize Naruto on account of the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox – a malevolent creature that attacked Konohagakure – that was sealed away in Naruto's body. Despite this, he aspires to become his village's leader, the Hokage, in order to receive their approval. His carefree, optimistic and boisterous personality enables him to befriend other Konohagakure ninja, as well as ninja from other villages.</p>
